# auto-scheduler

Schedules your meetings for you

## Goal

1. Collaboration with others who are already on our service to auto-schedule a
   meeting
   - Require approval -- either email back or from our website's dashboard
2. Handle an email request for meeting -- can dismiss
   - Reply with available times ("Hi, I'm Name's personal assistant. Do any of
     these times work for you?")
     - Future: detect times if someone suggested them
